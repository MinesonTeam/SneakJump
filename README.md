# SneakJump

SneakJump is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that adds a smooth and consistent **SHIFT + jump** mechanic, allowing players to jump higher with a fully configurable jump height.
The jump boost is calculated using a physics-based approach (gravity and tick-based motion) to keep jump heights predictable across different server environments.

## Features

- Jump higher by holding **SHIFT** and jumping
- Configurable jump height
- Physics-based calculation with gravity and velocity decay
- Enable/disable via config
- World whitelist support
- Customizable messages
- Permission-based access control
- Works great for survival, RPG, PvP, and minigames

## Permissions

- `sneakjump.jump` - Allows the player to use the enhanced jump. Players without this permission will jump normally.

## Commands

- `/sneakjump help` - Displays all available commands
- `/sneakjump reload` - Reloads the plugin configuration
